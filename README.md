## Getting Started

To clone the project to your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Git Bash installed on your Windows system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Avazkhon-tech/gym_crm_microservices.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory. 
4. Run the following command to cleanly build all three services:
   ```bash
   ./easy-build.sh
   ```
   
   If you encounter issues running the script, you can build each project individually.
   first cd into the module then run
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

5. Start the services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

  "olim.karimov",
  "sardor.tursunov",
  "bekzod.mahmudov",
  "jasur.norboyev"
]
```
## Accessing the System
- You can view the API documentation at [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html#).
- You can access ActiveMQ admin panel using `admin` as both username and password at [ActiveMQ](http://localhost:8161/admin/queues.jsp)
- You can access Mongo express using `user` as both username and password at [Mongo Express](http://localhost:8000)

To observe the message broker in action, turn off the trainer workload service. 
Once you restart it, the service will consume requests from the queue. 
After a few seconds, you can access the H2 console to verify that the process was successful.
